            JAMB Releases 2025 Mock UTME Results: How to Check Your Score via SMS


            </h3>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
            The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has officially released the results of the 2025 Mock Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), which was conducted on Thursday, April 10, 2025. This mock examination serves as a preparatory test for candidates ahead of the main UTME.​

Candidates who participated in the mock exam can now check their results by sending the keyword "MOCKRESULT" via SMS to either 55019 or 66019 using the phone number they used during registration. This method ensures quick and easy access to individual scores. ​
<br /><br />

The mock exam is designed to familiarize candidates with the Computer-Based Test (CBT) environment and to assess the effectiveness of JAMB's examination delivery system. ​
