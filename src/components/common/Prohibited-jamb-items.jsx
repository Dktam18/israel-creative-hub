              JAMB 2025 UTME: Strict Warning on Prohibited Items – What Candidates Must Know
            </h3>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              As the 2024 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) approaches, the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has issued a stern reminder on the list of items strictly prohibited at all examination venues. This move is part of the Board's zero-tolerance policy against exam malpractice and its commitment to maintaining the integrity of Nigeria's educational system.
              <br /><br />
              According to the Board, items such as <strong>mobile phones</strong>, <strong>watches</strong>, <strong>calculators</strong>, <strong>pen readers</strong>, <strong>smart lenses</strong>, <strong>earpieces</strong>, and even <strong>books or writing materials</strong> are banned from the exam hall. The prohibition also extends to smart rings, USBs, CDs, and spy glasses, among others.
              <br /><br />
              These items have been known to aid cheating, and their presence, even unintentionally, could result in the disqualification of a candidate. JAMB has reiterated that candidates caught with any of the listed items will face serious sanctions, which may include a ban from future exams or legal prosecution.
              <br /><br />
              Candidates are urged to strictly comply with these rules to avoid jeopardizing their future. The Board emphasizes that this effort is not just to punish but to ensure a level playing field where all candidates compete fairly based on their preparation and merit.
              <br /><br />
              JAMB’s continued vigilance and enforcement of these regulations serve as a deterrent to malpractice and reinforce its mission to deliver credible and transparent examinations across the country.
              <br /><br />
              As you prepare for the 2024 UTME, remember: <strong>“TO BE FOREWARNED IS TO BE FOREARMED.”</strong> Adhere to all JAMB policies and bring only what is required. Your integrity is your passport to success.
