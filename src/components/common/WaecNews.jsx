              WAEC withdraws recognition of 574 schools ahead of 2025 WASSCE
            </h3>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              The West African Examinations Council (WAEC), Nigeria, has taken strict action against malpractice by withdrawing the recognition of <b>574 secondary schools</b> found guilty of involvement in examination misconduct. These schools will not be permitted to host or conduct exams during the upcoming 2025 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE), which begins on <b>Thursday, April 24, 2025</b>.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              This was made known by the Head of WAEC's National Office, <b>Dr. Amos Dangut</b>, during a press briefing held at the WAEC headquarters in Lagos. He stated that the names of the affected schools have been forwarded to the Federal Government for further action.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              “This year, we have submitted a list of 574 schools whose licenses have been withdrawn as recognized examination centers. We will no longer conduct examinations in those locations,” Dangut announced.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              The 2025 WASSCE is scheduled to run from <b>April 24 to June 20, 2025</b>, with a total of <b>1,973,253 candidates</b> registered from <b>23,554 schools</b>. The gender breakdown shows <b>979,228 male</b> and <b>994,025 female</b> candidates, reflecting an increase of over 158,000 candidates compared to last year.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              WAEC also announced the introduction of its first ever <b>Computer-Based WASSCE (CB-WASSCE)</b> for school candidates. This is part of the Council’s digital transformation to improve examination delivery through technology.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              “Two candidates will not have the same questions for each question number,” Dangut added, highlighting efforts to maintain academic integrity by varying question formats using new digital systems.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              Lastly, WAEC acknowledged ongoing security challenges in some regions, but assured that they are working closely with the police and state authorities to ensure a smooth and safe examination process.
