              JAMB 2025: Full result breakdown of the UTME exam
            </h3>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has released the official statistical breakdown of the 2025 UTME results. A total of 1,955,069 candidates participated in the exam. Shockingly, more than half—<b>50.29%</b>—scored between 160 and 199.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              Only <b>0.63%</b> (12,414 candidates) scored above 300, while a mere <b>0.24%</b> (4,756 candidates) scored 320 or above. The majority of students clustered between 140–199, with <b>488,197</b> scoring between 140–159 and <b>983,187</b> between 160–199.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              Alarmingly, 2,031 candidates scored below 100, and <b>only 3.76%</b> (73,441) scored between 250–299. This raises concerns about overall academic preparedness heading into tertiary institutions.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              JAMB also revealed that <b>40,247 underage candidates</b> sat for the exam to demonstrate exceptional ability. However, only 467 of them (just <b>1.16%</b>) scored high enough to qualify for further consideration under the special talent track.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              On the disciplinary front, <b>97 candidates</b> were caught in examination malpractices, while <b>2,157</b> are under investigation. An additional <b>71,701 candidates</b> were absent—some of whom face biometric or identity verification issues. Candidates cleared of these issues will be rescheduled.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              A few result cases, especially those involving blind candidates and JEOG applicants, are still under processing. JAMB has promised a detailed press briefing later this week to announce the release of individual results and further guidance.
