              NMCN Approves SAISSCE as Valid Entry for Nursing Programme Admissions
            </h3>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              The Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria (NMCN) has officially directed nursing institutions nationwide to recognize the **Senior Arabic and Islamic Secondary School Certificate Examination (SAISSCE)** as an acceptable alternative to **WAEC and NECO** for admission into nursing programmes.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              This directive was issued via a circular signed by **Ndagi Alhassan**, the Acting Registrar and CEO of NMCN. The circular was shared with key educational stakeholders including commissioners of health, nursing directors, vice chancellors, and teaching hospitals across the country.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              The Council reaffirmed that SAISSCE holds the same academic recognition as other senior secondary certificates, urging institutions to consider qualified applicants in alignment with each programmeâ€™s admission requirements.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              The recognition of SAISSCE stems from a decision reached during the **57th National Council on Education meeting** held in Sokoto in February 2011, where the Federal Government endorsed the certificate as an equivalent qualification.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[14px] leading-5 my-3">
              The NMCN emphasized that this move aligns with its commitment to inclusivity, equal access to education, and the promotion of global best practices in nursing education. Institutions have been urged to strictly comply with this directive moving forward.
